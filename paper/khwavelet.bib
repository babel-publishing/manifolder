In addition to the O VI and C III lines typical of UVCS spectra of CMEs, this 480 km s -1 CME exhibits the forbidden and intercombination lines of O V at ??1213.8 and 1218.4. The relative intensities of the O V lines represent an accurate electron density diagnostic not generally available at 3.5 R ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} . By combining the density with the column density derived from LASCO, we obtain the emission measure of the ejected gas. With the help of models of the temperature and time-dependent ionization state of the expanding gas, we determine a range of heating rates required to account for the UV emission lines. The total thermal energy deposited as the gas travels to 3.5 R ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} is comparable to the kinetic and gravitational potential energies. We note a core of colder material radiating in C III , surrounded by hotter material radiating in the O V and O VI lines. This concentration of the coolest material into small regions may be a common feature of CMEs. This event thus represents a unique opportunity to describe the morphology of a CME, and to characterize its plasma parameters.}

Journal = GRL,

Abstract = {We report on electron phase space distributions (PSDs) observed near
   the plasma sheet (PS) boundary layer (PSBL) by the Cluster electron
   spectrometers when the northern lobe was occupied by significant fluxes
   of polar rain (PR) electrons. These observations reveal the spatial
   structure of the electron transition layer (TL) between the polar rain
   electrons and the PSBL electron population accelerated during
   reconnection. This TL comprises overlapping spatial dispersion
   signatures in both energy and pitch angle, which are caused by
   convection of flux tubes across the magnetic separatrix during the
   electron time-of-flight (TOF) from the X-line combined with
   acceleration in the reconnection region. Analysis of this structure
   allows us to estimate the location of the X-line. By assuming the PSBL
   population arises through acceleration of the PR electrons, comparison
   of their PSD indicates that the electrons gain energy proportional to
   their initial energy.},

Abstract = {{Magnetospheric substorms explosively release solar wind energy
   previously stored in Earth's magnetotail, encompassing the entire
   magnetosphere and producing spectacular auroral displays. It has been
   unclear whether a substorm is triggered by a disruption of the
   electrical current flowing across the near- Earth magnetotail, at
   similar to 10 R-E ( R-E: Earth radius, or 6374 kilometers), or by the
   process of magnetic reconnection typically seen farther out in the
   magnetotail, at similar to 20 to 30 R-E. We report on simultaneous
   measurements in the magnetotail at multiple distances, at the time of
   substorm onset. Reconnection was observed at 20 R-E, at least 1.5
   minutes before auroral intensification, at least 2 minutes before
   substorm expansion, and about 3 minutes before near- Earth current
   disruption. These results demonstrate that substorms are likely
   initiated by tail reconnection.}},

Title = {{Electron flat-top distributions around the magnetic reconnection region}},
Journal = JGR,
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{A1}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Cluster multisatellite observations provide snapshots of electron
   distributions around the magnetic neutral line. An isotropic
   flat-top-type electron distribution in phase space is frequently
   observed around the X line, together with large ion velocities and a
   Hall quadrupole-like magnetic field inside the hot and tenuous plasma
   sheet in the magnetotail. The flat-top distributions are also
   associated with a finite magnetic field in the direction normal to the
   neutral sheet, and the cross-tail current density is sometimes very
   small. These results indicate that the flat-top-type distribution is
   mainly located near the outer boundary of the ion diffusion region in
   the plasma sheet outflow region, before reaching the pileup region with
   large normal component of the magnetic field. Simultaneously with the
   flat-top distributions, strong field-aligned electron beams mainly
   toward the X line are occasionally observed. This type of beam is
   mainly observed in the off-equatorial plasma sheet and also appears
   well inside the plasma sheet. Typical energies of the beam are 4-10
   keV, which is comparable to the upper edge of flat-top energy. These
   highly accelerated electron distributions have a steep decrease in
   phase space density at the high-energy end, and it is found that they
   are not correlated with the increase of the higher-energy electrons
   related to suprathermal acceleration (> 30 keV). This result indicates
   that the electron acceleration processes for the flat-top-type
   distributions are different from the suprathermal components, both of
   which are beyond the conventional MHD outflow acceleration and
   considered to be associated with some kinetic processes.}},

Journal = JGR,

Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{A7}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{On the 18th of August 2002, during a crossing of the near-Earth plasma
   sheet Cluster observed an ion flow burst, caused by a near-Earth
   reconnection event. Cluster observed a tailward bulk flow which reverse
   to earthward flow, indicating a close passage of the diffusion region.
   We show that reversals in B-Z and B-Y are consistent with reconnection.
   During the event, a short duration burst of electrons in the range of a
   few keV up to more than 100 keV are observed streaming away from the
   reconnection region. The accelerated electrons were aligned with the
   magnetic field, streaming tailward, and were observed simultaneously by
   all four spacecraft located on both the northern and southern side of
   the current sheet. The four Cluster spacecraft, separated by similar to
   3700 km, observe the electrons for a time period of similar to 60 s,
   indicating the burst to be a temporal rather than localized feature. A
   second burst of tailward accelerated electrons observed for similar to
   40 s was observed by Cluster 1 and 2 upon entering the earthward
   outflow region. The second beam thus appear to be directed toward the
   X-line. The flux levels of the energetic electron bursts exceed those
   of the ambient plasma sheet by a factor 2 - 4. In general, the highest
   energetic electron fluxes during this event were observed in the
   earthward outflow region. Observations indicate that reconnection
   operates on closed plasma sheet field lines in this event and does not
   reach lobe field lines.}},

Title = {Properties of asymmetric magnetic reconnection},
Journal = POP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Properties of magnetic reconnection are investigated in
   two-dimensional, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of
   current sheets separating plasmas with different magnetic field
   strengths and densities. Specific emphasis is on the influence of the
   external parameters on the reconnection rate. The effect of the
   dissipation in the resistive MHD model is separated from this influence
   by evaluating resistivity dependence together with the dependence on
   the background parameters. Two scenarios are considered, which may be
   distinguished as driven and nondriven reconnection. In either scenario,
   the maximum reconnection rate (electric field) is found to depend on
   appropriate hybrid expressions based on a magnetic field strength and
   an Alfven speed derived from the characteristic values in the two
   inflow regions. The scaling compares favorably with an analytic formula
   derived recently by Cassak and Shay {[}Phys. Plasmas 14, 102114 (2007)]
   applied to the regime of fast reconnection. An investigation of the
   energy flow and conversion in the vicinity of the reconnection site
   revealed a significant role of enthalpy flux generation, in addition to
   the expected conversion of Poynting flux to kinetic energy flux. This
   enthalpy flux generation results from Ohmic heating as well as
   adiabatic, that is, compressional heating. The latter is found more
   important when the magnetic field strengths in the two inflow regions
   are comparable in magnitude. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Journal = POP,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Using two-dimensional compressible-magnetohydrodynamic computer
   simulations, the reconnection of magnetic fields between two plasmas
   with different mass densities is examined. Antiparallel, undriven
   merging is studied from a Harris-sheet initial condition with the sheet
   separating the two different plasmas. Reconnection is initiated with a
   resistive spot in the center of the Harris sheet. Density ratios from 1
   to 320 are simulated. It is found that the rate of magnetic-field
   reconnection R is give approximately as R=0.07 upsilon(Ah), where
   upsilon(Ah)=B/{[}4 pi(0.5 rho(1)+0.5 rho(1))](1/2) is a hybrid Alfven
   speed constructed by averaging the densities of the two plasmas. In the
   symmetric-density case, plasma jetting speeds are equal to the local
   ExB velocity; in the asymmetric-density cases, the plasma jetting
   speeds exceed the local ExB velocity. In the asymmetric cases, plasma
   jetting tends to be parallel to the local magnetic field. In the
   symmetric-density case the plasma jetting arises from the site of the
   X-line and resides in the region of magnetic-field reversal; in the
   asymmetric case, jetting tends to reside in the lower-density plasma.

Abstract = {{Several new experimental results are reported from spheromak merging
   studies at the Swarthmore Spheromak Experiment {[}M. R. Brown, Phys.
   Plasmas 6, 1717 (1999)] with relevance to three-dimensional (3D)
   reconnection in laboratory and space plasmas. First, recent velocity
   measurements of impurity ions using ion Doppler spectroscopy are
   reported. Bidirectional outflow at nearly the Alfven speed is clearly
   observed. Second, experimental measurements of the out-of-plane
   magnetic field in a reconnection volume showing a quadrupolar structure
   at the ion inertial scale are discussed. Third, a measurement of
   in-plane Hall electric field and nonideal terms of the generalized
   Ohm's law in a reconnection volume of a weakly collisional laboratory
   plasma is presented. Time resolved vector magnetic field measurements
   on a 3D lattice {[}B(r,t)] enables evaluation of the various terms.
   Results show that the Hall electric field dominates everywhere (JxB/ne)
   and also exhibits a quadrupolar structure at the ion inertial scale;
   resistive and electron inertia terms are small. Each of these is
   related to and compared with similar measurements in a solar or space
   context. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{The acceleration of charged particles at a two-dimensional magnetic
   reconnection site is investigated. The magnetic field has an X-type
   neutral point, while reconnection is driven by a uniform transverse
   electric field; the effect of including a uniform magnetic field
   component parallel to the driving electric field and transverse to the
   plane of the X point is studied. We focus on the adiabatic motion of
   strongly magnetized particles, a valid assumption everywhere for
   sufficiently strong parallel magnetic fields but one which excludes a
   region around the neutral point for weaker fields. The regime of
   interest is fast driven reconnection, in which the electric drift is
   strong. The trajectories of particles and their dependence on the
   magnitude of the parallel magnetic field component are investigated.
   Particles can be accelerated along the magnetic field lines both
   because of the coupling of the perpendicular electric drift with the
   parallel motion, which occurs in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, and
   the direct acceleration by the electric field. The energy spectra of
   particles leaving the reconnection site are also calculated.}},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A Sweet-Parker-type scaling analysis for asymmetric antiparallel
   reconnection (in which the reconnecting magnetic field strengths and
   plasma densities are different on opposite sides of the dissipation
   region) is performed. Scaling laws for the reconnection rate, outflow
   speed, the density of the outflow, and the structure of the dissipation
   region are derived from first principles. These results are independent
   of the dissipation mechanism. It is shown that a generic feature of
   asymmetric reconnection is that the X-line and stagnation point are not
   colocated, leading to a bulk flow of plasma across the X-line. The
   scaling laws are verified using two-dimensional resistive
   magnetohydrodynamics numerical simulations for the special case of
   asymmetric magnetic fields with symmetric density. Observational
   signatures and applications to reconnection in the magnetosphere are
   discussed. (C) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

Title = {{Cluster observations of electron holes in association with magnetotail
   reconnection and comparison to simulations}},
Journal = JGR,
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{A1}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] Large-amplitude ( up to similar to50 mV/m) solitary waves,
   identified as electron holes, have been observed during waveform
   captures on two of the four Cluster satellites during several plasma
   sheet encounters that have been identified as the passage of a
   magnetotail reconnection x line. The electron holes were seen near the
   outer edge of the plasma sheet, within and on the edge of a density
   cavity, at distances on the order of a few ion inertial lengths from
   the center of the current sheet. The electron holes occur during
   intervals when there were narrow electron beams but not when the
   distributions were more isotropic or contained beams that were broad in
   pitch angle. The region containing the narrow beams ( and therefore the
   electron holes) can extend over thousands of kilometers in the x and y
   directions, but is very narrow in the z direction. The association with
   electron beams and the density cavity and the location along the
   separatrices are consistent with simulations shown herein. The
   velocities and scale sizes of the electron holes are consistent with
   the predictions of Drake et al. {[} 2003]. Particle simulations of
   magnetic reconnection reproduce the observed Cluster data only with the
   addition of a small (0.2 of the reversed field) ambient guide field.
   The results suggest that electron holes may sometimes be an intrinsic
   feature of magnetotail reconnection and that in such cases the
   traditional neglect of the guide field may not be justified. Very large
   amplitude lower hybrid waves ( hundreds of millivolts per meter), as
   well as waves at frequencies up to the electron plasma frequency, were
   also observed during this interval.}},

Abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is the underlying process that releases
   impulsively an enormous amount of magnetic energy(1) in solar
   flares(2,3), flares on strongly magnetized neutron stars(4) and
   substorms in the Earth's magnetosphere(5). Studies of energy release
   during solar flares, in particular, indicate that up to 50\% of the
   released energy is carried by accelerated 20-100 keV suprathermal
   electrons(6-8). How so many electrons can gain so much energy during
   reconnection has been a long-standing question. A recent theoretical
   study suggests that volume-filling contracting magnetic islands formed
   during reconnection can produce a large number of energetic
   electrons(9). Here we report the first evidence of the link between
   energetic electrons and magnetic islands during reconnection in the
   Earth's magnetosphere. The results indicate that energetic electron
   fluxes peak at sites of compressed density within islands, which
   imposes a new constraint on theories of electron acceleration.},

Abstract = {{We have identified a spatially extended electron current sheet (ECS)
   and its adjacent magnetic island during a magnetotail reconnection
   event with no appreciable guide field. This finding is based on data
   from the four Cluster spacecraft and is enabled by detailed maps of
   electron distribution functions and DC electric fields within the
   diffusion region. The maps are developed using two-dimensional
   particle-in-cell simulations with a mass ratio m(i)/m(e) = 800. One
   spacecraft crossed the ECS earthward of the reconnection null and,
   together with the other three spacecraft, registered the following
   properties: (1) The ECS is colocated with a layer of bipolar electric
   fields normal to the ECS, pointing toward the ECS, and with a half
   width less than 8 electron skin depths. (2) In the inflow region up to
   the ECS and separatrices, electrons have a temperature anisotropy
   (Te-parallel to/Te-perpendicular to > 1), and the anisotropy increases
   toward the ECS. (3) Within about 1 ion skin depth (d(i)) above and
   below the ECS, the electron density decreases toward the ECS by a
   factor of 3-4, reaching a minimum at edges of the ECS, and has a local
   distinct maximum at the ECS center. (4) A di-scale magnetic island is
   attached to the ECS, separating it from another reconnection layer. Our
   simulations established that the electric field normal to the ECS is
   due to charge imbalance and is of the ECS scale, and ions exhibit
   electron-scale structures in response to this electric field.}},

Abstract = {{Most satellite-based in situ plasma experiments are affected in some
   manner by the electrostatic structure surrounding the spacecraft. In
   order to better understand this structure, we have developed a fully
   three-dimensional self-consistent model that can accept realistic
   spacecraft geometry, including both thin (similar to 10(-4) m) wires
   and long (similar to 10(2) m) booms, with open boundary conditions. The
   model uses an integral formulation incorporating boundary element,
   multigrid and fast multipole methods to overcome problems associated
   with the large range in scale sizes and inherently three-dimensional
   structure. By applying the model to the Cluster spacecraft, we show
   that the electric potential structure is dominated by the charge on the
   wire booms, with the spacecraft body contributing at small distances.
   Consequently, the potential near the EFW ( Electric Fields and Waves
   experiment) probes at the end of the wire booms is typically
   significantly above the true plasma potential. For the Cluster
   spacecraft, we show that this effect causes a 19\% underestimation of
   the spacecraft potential and 13\% underestimation of the ambient
   electric field. We further assess the electric field due to the
   sunward-oriented photoelectron cloud, showing that the cloud
   contributes little to the observed spurious sunward field in the EFW
   data.}},

Abstract = {A long-standing problem in the study of space and astrophysical plasmas
   is to explain the production of energetic electrons as magnetic fields
   `reconnect' and release energy. In the Earth's magnetosphere, electron
   energies reach hundreds of thousands of electron volts (refs 1 - 3),
   whereas the typical electron energies associated with large-scale
   reconnection-driven flows are just a few electron volts. Recent
   observations further suggest that these energetic particles are
   produced in the region where the magnetic field reconnects(4). In solar
   flares, upwards of 50 per cent of the energy released can appear as
   energetic electrons(5,6). Here we show that electrons gain kinetic
   energy by reflecting from the ends of the contracting `magnetic
   islands' that form as reconnection proceeds. The mechanism is analogous
   to the increase of energy of a ball reflecting between two converging
   walls - the ball gains energy with each bounce. The repetitive
   interaction of electrons with many islands allows large numbers to be
   efficiently accelerated to high energy. The back pressure of the
   energetic electrons throttles reconnection so that the electron energy
   gain is a large fraction of the released magnetic energy. The resultant
   energy spectra of electrons take the form of power laws with spectral
   indices that match the magnetospheric observations.},

Abstract = {{Magnetic reconnection near the surface of the sun and in the Earth's
   magnetotail is associated with the production of highly energetic
   electrons. Direct acceleration in the reconnection electric field has
   been proposed as a possible mechanism for energizing these electrons.
   Here, however, we use kinetic simulations of guide-field reconnection
   to show that in two-dimensional (2D) reconnection the parallel electric
   field, E-parallel to in the reconnection region is localized and its
   structure does not permit significant energization of the electrons.
   Rather, a large fraction of the electrons become trapped due to a sign
   reversal in E-parallel to, imposing strict constraints on their motions
   and energizations. Given these new results, simple 2D models, which
   invoke direct acceleration for energizing electrons during a single
   encounter with a reconnection region, need to be revised.}},

  abstract={For a Boltzmann distribution function, neglecting collisions and in the presence of a longitudinal external magnetic field, the self-consistent equilibrium configuration is found for a plasma with components s ; this configuration represents an infinitely extended plane layer consisting of periodically recurring quasi-filaments of current for each of which the Bennett self-focusing condition I = 2 ? s / q s � s is fulfilled. The filaments may be considered the result of the continuous topological transformation of a homogeneous plane layer having the characteristic dimension k g0 2 = 2 p n 0 S ( q s 2 � s 2 /? s 2 ) since the condition indicated is fulfilled for an element of the homogeneous layer in the range �8= x =8, �p/ k g0 = y = p/ k g0 . During this transformation the characteristic dimensions, the total current and the energy of the y component of the magnetic field of the filaments remain constant. With increasing depth of the modulation, characterized by the parameter ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/5/3/003/nf_5_3_003inline1.gif] {\y=\sqrt{n\max}-\sqrt{n\min}} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/5/3/003/nf_5_3_003inline2.gif] {\(\sqrt{n\max}+\sqrt{n\min})} only the energy of the x component of the magnetic field grows (proportionally to y in the linear case). The authors examined the stability of a homogeneous plane layer with respect to perturbations of the type j z =j z (x) exp (?t+i ky), as well as the factors giving rise to filaments and their in high current discharge processes.}

Abstract = {{We report the observation of large-amplitude, nonlinear electrostatic
   structures, identified as electron phase-space holes, during magnetic
   reconnection experiments on the Versatile Toroidal Facility at MIT. The
   holes are positive electric potential spikes, observed on
   high-bandwidth (similar to 2 GHz) Langmuir probes. Investigations with
   multiple probes establish that the holes travel at or above the
   electron thermal speed and have a three-dimensional, approximately
   spherical shape, with a scale size similar to 2 mm. This corresponds to
   a few electron gyroradii, or many tens of Debye lengths, which is large
   compared to holes considered in simulations and observed by satellites,
   whose length scale is typically only a few Debye lengths. Finally, a
   statistical study over many discharges confirms that the holes appear
   in conjunction with the large inductive electric fields and the
   creation of energetic electrons associated with the magnetic energy
   release.}},

At the time of the radio enhancement, coronagraphic images show a fast CME overtaking a slow CME. We interpret the radio enhancement as a consequence of shock strengthening when the shock ahead of the fast CME plows through the core of the preceding slow CME. The duration of the radio enhancement is consistent with the transit time of the CME-driven shock through the core of the slow CME. As a consequence of the interaction, the core of the slow CME changed its trajectory significantly. Based on the emission characteristics of the radio enhancement, we estimate the density of the core of the slow CME to be ~4 × 10 4 cm -3 . The CME interaction has important implications for space weather prediction based on halo CMEs: some of the false alarms could be accounted for by CME interactions. The observed CME interaction could also explain some of the complex ejecta at 1 AU, which have unusual composition.}

Abstract = {{The electric-field and wave experiment (EFW) on Cluster is designed to
   measure the electric-field and density fluctuations with sampling rates
   up to 36 000 samples s(-1). Langmuir probe sweeps can also be made to
   determine the electron density and temperature. The instrument has
   several important capabilities. These include (1) measurements of
   quasi-static electric fields of amplitudes lip to 700 mV m(-1) with
   high amplitude and time resolution, (2) measurements over short periods
   of time of up to five simualtaneous waveforms (two electric signals and
   three magnetic signals from the seach coil magnetometer sensors) of a
   bandwidth of 4 kHz with high time resolution, (3) measurements of
   density fluctuations in four points with high time resolution. Among
   the more interesting scientific objectives of the experiment are
   studies of nonlinear wave phenomena that result in acceleration of
   plasma as well as large- and small-scale interferometric measurements.
   By using four spacecraft for large-scale differential measurements and
   several Langmuir probes on one spacecraft for small-scale
   interferometry, it will be possible to study motion and shape of plasma
   structures on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. This paper
   describes the primary scientific objectives of the EFW experiment and
   the technical capabilities of the instrument.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the energy spectra produced by a simple
   test particle X-point model of a solar flare for different
   configurations of the initial electromagnetic field. We find that once
   the reconnection electric field is larger than 1 Vm(-1) the particle
   distribution transits from a heated one to a partially accelerated one.
   As we close the separatrices of the X-point and the angle in the inflow
   direction widens we find that more particles are accelerated out of the
   thermal distribution and this power-law component extends to lower
   energies. When we introduce a guiding magnetic field component we find
   that more particles are energised, but only up to a maximum energy
   dictated primarily by the reconnection electric field. Despite being
   able to accelerate particles to observable energies and demonstrate
   behaviour in the energy spectra that is consistent with observations,
   this single X-line model can only deliver the number fluxes required
   for microflares.}},

Abstract = {Hard X-ray observations provide the most direct diagnostic we have of
   the suprathermal electrons and the hottest thermal plasma present in
   solar flares. The Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
   (RHESSI) is obtaining the most comprehensive observations of individual
   solar flares ever available in hard X-rays. For the first time,
   high-resolution spectra are available for a large number of flares that
   accurately display the spectral shape and its evolution and, in many
   cases, allow us to identify the transition from the bremsstrahlung
   X-rays produced by suprathermal electrons to the bremsstrahlung at
   lower energies emitted by thermal plasma. Also, for the first time,
   images can be produced in arbitrary energy bands above 3-4 keV, and
   spectra of distinct imaged components can be obtained.
   I review what we have learned from RHESSI observations about flare
   suprathermal electron distributions and their evolution. Next, I
   present computations of the energy deposited by these suprathermal
   electrons in individual flares and compare this with the energy
   contained in the hot thermal plasma. I point out unsolved problems in
   deducing both suprathermal electron distributions and the energy
   content of the thermal plasma, and discuss possible solutions. Finally,
   I present evidence that electron acceleration is associated with
   magnetic reconnection in the corona. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {{The suprathermal electrons of greater than or equal to 20 keV that
   extend front the hot thermal electron with 2 - 3 keV temperature are
   sometimes observed in Earth's magnetosphere in association with
   reconnection. We study the origin of the hot and suprathermal electrons
   in terms of the kinetic magnetic reconnection process by using the
   two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation. We find that the hot and
   suprathermal electrons call be formed in the nonlinear evolution of a
   large-scale magnetic reconnection. The electrons are, at, the first
   stage.. accelerated in the elongated, thin, X-type current sheet. Next
   the preheated/accelerated electrons are transported to the stronger
   magnetic field region produced by piling up of magnetic field lines due
   to colliding of the fast reconnection outflow with the preexisting
   plasma. In this region they are further accelerated owing to the delB
   drift and the curvature drift. The mirror force of the reconnecting
   magnetic fields, the effective pitch angle scattering that occurs when
   the Larmor radius is comparable to the magnetic field line curvature
   radius, and the broadband waves excited by the Hall electric current
   are the other important agents to control the particle acceleration.}},

Abstract = {{An electron analyser to measure the three-dimensional velocity
   distribution of electrons in the energy range from 0.59 eV to 26.4 keV
   on the four spacecraft of the Cluster mission is described. The
   instrument consists of two sensors with hemispherical electrostatic
   energy analysers with a position-sensitive microchannel plate detectors
   placed to view radially on opposite sides of the spacecraft. The
   intrinsic energy resolutions of the two sensors are 12.7\% and 16.5\%
   full width at half maximum. Their angular resolutions are 2.8 degrees
   and 5.3 degrees respectively in an azimuthal direction and 15 degrees
   in a polar direction. The two sensors will normally measure in
   different overlapping energy ranges and will scan the distribution in
   half a spacecraft rotation or 2 s in the overlapped range. While this
   is the fastest time resolution for complete distributions, partial
   distributions can be recorded in as little as 62.5 ms and angular
   distributions at a fixed energy in 7.8 ms. The dynamic range of the
   instrument is sufficient to provide accurate measurements of the main
   known populations from the tail lobe to the plasmasheet and the solar
   wind. While the basic structure of the instrument is conventional,
   special attention has been paid in the design to improving the
   precision of the instrument so that a relative of the order of 1\%
   could be attained in flight in order to measure the gradients between
   the four spacecraft accurately; to decreasing the minimum energy
   covered by this technique from 10 eV down to 1 eV; and to providing
   good three dimensional distributions.}},

Abstract = {{{[} 1] During storm times, O+ can dominate both the pressure and the
   density in the plasma sheet. Because of the contribution from ion
   outflow, the plasma sheet is already oxygen-rich prior to substorm
   onset. At substorm onset the fraction of O+ contributing to the
   pressure and density increases. In the O+ dominated thin current sheet
   the O+ ions are observed to stream from dawn to dusk across the tail,
   as predicted for nonadiabatic ions by Speiser ( 1965). We calculate the
   current contribution from these ions and find that they carry about
   5-10\% of the cross-tail current. During a nonstormtime substorm the
   general behavior of the O+ is the same. However, because there is less
   O+ present, the O+ never dominates over H+, and the contribution to the
   cross-tail current is even less.}},

Abstract = {We present a new, higher-order, two-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic
   model for the detailed internal structure of bubbles produced by the
   onset of merging along a single subsolar X line. The key feature of the
   model is to implement a nonlinear filter to postprocess results
   provided by the pseudospectral element method. The devised nonlinear
   filter (1) eliminates only the high-frequency oscillations, (2) retains
   conservation laws, and (3) enforces a total variation diminished
   criterion to guarantee the elimination of spurious oscillations near
   discontinuities. For realistic parameters, the model predicts that
   satellites which remain in the magnetosheath will observe asymmetric
   bipolar magnetic field signatures normal to the magnetopause, magnetic
   field strength increases, density and temperature decreases, and
   velocities opposite the motion of the events. Satellites in the
   magnetosheath which enter the events observe asymmetric bipolar
   signatures normal to the magnetopause, magnetic field strength
   decreases, densities intermediate between those in the magnetosheath
   and magnetosphere, temperature increases, and velocities in the
   direction of event motion. Satellites initially located just outside
   the the magnetopause observe greatly depressed densities and enhanced
   temperatures (but no significant bipolar signatures normal to the
   magnetopause) followed by velocity jets of magnetosheath-like plasma on
   northward magnetospheric magnetic field lines. Satellites in the
   magnetosphere which enter the events observe depressed magnetic field
   strengths, enhanced densities and temperatures, and accelerated flows
   surrounding a core region of accelerated magnetosheath-like plasma.
   Neither they nor satellites which remain in the magnetosphere observe
   any significant bipolar signatures normal to the nominal magnetopause.},

    abstract = {Examining flare data observed by Transition Region and Coronal Explorer satellite from 1998 May to 2006 December, we choose 190 (151 M-class and 39 X-class) flare events which display post-flare loops (PFLs), observed by 171 A and 195 A wavelengths. One-hundred twenty-four of the 190 events exhibit flare ribbons (FRs), observed by 1600 A images. We investigate the propagation of the brightening of these PFLs along the neutral lines and the separation of the FRs perpendicular to the neutral lines. Observations indicate that the footpoints of the initial brightening PFLs are always associated with the change of the photospheric magnetic fields. In most of the cases, the length of the FRs ranges from 20 Mm to 170 Mm. The propagating duration of the brightening is from 10 to 60 minutes, and from 10 to 70 minutes for the separating duration of the FRs. The velocities of the propagation and the separation range from 3 to 39 km s-1 and 3 to 15 km s-1, respectively. Both the propagating velocities and the separating velocities are associated with the flare strength and the length of the FRs. It appears that the propagation and the separation are dynamically coupled; the greater the propagating velocity, the faster the separation. Furthermore, a greater propagating velocity corresponds to a greater deceleration (or acceleration). These PFLs display three types of propagating patterns. In type I propagation, which includes about half of all the events, the brightening begins at the middle part of a set of PFLs, and propagates bidirectionally toward both of its ends. For type II, including 30\% of all events, the brightening first appears at one end of a set of PFLs, then propagates to the other end. The remaining events belong to type III propagation, which display the initial brightening taking place at two (or more than two) positions on two (or more than two) sets of PFLs, then propagating bidirectionally along the neutral line.

Journal = AJ,
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{462}},
Number = {{2, Part 1}},
Pages = {{997-1004}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Motion of charged particles in a reconnecting current sheet (RCS) is
   considered, taking into account not only the electric field inside it
   but also all three components of the magnetic field. A new solution for
   the particle trajectory is found for the case of a large longitudinal
   magnetic field. It allows one to find the `'critical'' value of the
   field, beyond which the particle motion in the sheet becomes adiabatic.
   The longitudinal component in RCSs in the solar atmosphere is likely to
   exceed this value (typically 0.1 of the main reconnecting field for
   electrons). The longitudinal field tends to counteract the effect of
   the transverse magnetic field that serves to rapidly eject the
   particles out of the sheet. Hence, a longitudinal component on the
   order of the reconnecting component is necessary to explain the
   electron acceleration in RCSs up to 10-100 keV during the impulsive
   phase of solar flares. The electron acceleration length turns out to be
   5 orders of magnitude smaller than the RCS length, placing strong
   requirements on the electric field necessary to accelerate the
   particles. This indicates that it is necessary to modify the simplistic
   runaway acceleration models, which ignore the magnetic field
   altogether. Depending upon the magnetic field structure in the RCS, the
   energy can reside mainly in electrons or protons. Thus, the model gives
   a unified description for different regimes of particle acceleration in
   flares.}},

Abstract = {{We have surveyed field-aligned electrons at the lobe/plasma sheet
   boundary and their association with reconnection in the distant
   magnetotail where reconnection is quasi-steady and large scale.
   Asymmetric (in energy) counterstreaming electrons are detected in
   similar to 30\% of the boundary crossings when high-speed flows are
   present in the plasma sheet. In 98\% of the electron beam cases the
   low-energy electrons are directed toward and the higher-energy
   electrons directed away from the X-line. The well-organized (by the
   signs of B-x and V-x) quadrupolar pattern of the electrons indicates
   that these electrons are associated with reconnection. The low-energy
   electrons could be the outer part of the Hall current loop, similar to
   previous reports in the near-Earth region. The mean electron energy in
   the distant tail is a factor of ten lower than in the near Earth tail.
   Our observations suggest that the Hall effect can be detected even at
   large distances from the diffusion region.}},

Abstract = {{This paper, a review of the present status of existing models for
   particle acceleration during impulsive solar flares, was inspired by a
   week-long workshop held in the Fall of 1993 at NASA Goddard Space
   Flight Center. Recent observations from Yohkoh and the Compton Gamma
   Ray Observatory, and a reanalysis of older observations from the Solar
   Maximum Mission, have led to important new results concerning the
   location, timing, and efficiency of particle acceleration in flares.
   These are summarized in the first part of the review. Particle
   acceleration processes are then discussed, with;particular emphasis on
   new developments in stochastic acceleration by magnetohydrodynamic
   waves and direct electric field acceleration by both sub- and
   super-Dreicer electric fields. Finally, issues that arise when these
   mechanisms are incorporated into the large-scale flare structure are
   considered. Stochastic and super-Dreicer acceleration may occur either
   in a single large coronal reconnection site or at multiple
   `'fragmented'' energy release sites. Sub-Dreicer acceleration requires
   a highly filamented coronal current pattern. A particular issue that
   needs to be confronted by all theories is the apparent need for large
   magnetic field strengths in the flare energy release region.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the detailed structure of thin current sheets and
   their evolution during a substorm interval on 24 August 2003, when
   Cluster experienced several rapid current sheet crossings within a
   couple of ion gyrotimes. These crossings took place during an interval
   of high-speed ion flows with B-Z reversals and signatures of
   accelerated electrons, suggesting crossing of the reconnection region.
   On the basis of four-point observations with a tetrahedron scale of
   similar to 200 km, we could quantify for the first time the thickness
   of the current sheet, which was comparable to or less than one ion
   inertia length, and resolve some internal structures such as multiple
   peaks within these thin current sheets. Different patterns in j(X) and
   in electron anisotropy were identified during the current sheet
   crossings: two crossings during tailward flow interval exhibited a
   quadrupole-type Hall current in the ion diffusion region without a
   guide field, while one crossing during earthward flow showed a current
   system as predicted in the ion diffusion region under the presence of a
   guide field. Multiple flux rope type signatures or transient skewed
   structures are observed in the thin current sheets, particularly in
   regions where signatures of electron acceleration are observed. These
   observations suggest that three-dimensional localized/transient
   structures could play an essential role in the dynamics of the thin
   current sheets, while a gross X-line picture can be established only in
   an average sense.}},

Abstract = {Strong electron pressure anisotropy has been observed upstream of
   electron diffusion regions during reconnection in Earth's magnetotail

   we find that the anisotropy drives the electron current in the electron

   distribution function within this region at enhanced resolutions
   reveals its highly structured nature and the mechanism by which the

  abstract={The Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) on board Yohkoh revealed that the ejection of X-ray emitting plasmoid is sometimes observed in a solar flare. It was found that the ejected plasmoid is strongly accelerated during a peak in the hard X-ray (HXR) emission of the flare. In this paper, we present an examination of the GOES X 2.3 class flare that occurred at 14:51 UT on 2000 November 24. In the SXT images, we found "multiple" plasmoid ejections with velocities in the range of 250-1500 km s �1 , which showed blob-like or loop-like structures. Furthermore, we also found that each plasmoid ejection is associated with an impulsive burst of HXR emission. Although some correlation between plasmoid ejection and HXR emission has been discussed previously, our observation shows similar behavior for multiple plasmoid ejection such that each plasmoid ejection occurs during the strong energy release of the solar flare. As a result of temperature-emission measure analysis of such plasmoids, it was revealed that the apparent velocities and kinetic energies of the plasmoid ejections show a correlation with the peak intensities in the HXR emissions.}

Abstract = {Magnetic reconnection in a current sheet converts magnetic energy into
   particle energy, a process that is important in many laboratory(1),
   space(2,3) and astrophysical contexts(4-6). It is not known at present
   whether reconnection is fundamentally a process that can occur over an
   extended region in space or whether it is patchy and unpredictable in
   nature(7). Frequent reports of small-scale flux ropes and flow channels
   associated with reconnection(8-13) in the Earth's magnetosphere raise
   the possibility that reconnection is intrinsically patchy, with each
   reconnection X-line ( the line along which oppositely directed magnetic
   field lines reconnect) extending at most a few Earth radii (R-E), even
   though the associated current sheets span many tens or hundreds of R-E.
   Here we report three-spacecraft observations of accelerated flow
   associated with reconnection in a current sheet embedded in the solar
   wind flow, where the reconnection X-line extended at least 390R(E) ( or
   2.5 x 10(6) km). Observations of this and 27 similar events imply that
   reconnection is fundamentally a large-scale process. Patchy
   reconnection observed in the Earth's magnetosphere is therefore likely
   to be a geophysical effect associated with fluctuating boundary
   conditions, rather than a fundamental property of reconnection. Our
   observations also reveal, surprisingly, that reconnection can operate
   in a quasi-steady-state manner even when undriven by the external flow.},

Abstract = {large number (128) of Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer
   Explorers/Ion Release Module (AMPTE/IRM) crossings of the low-latitude
   (<30 degrees) dayside (0800-1600 LT) high-shear (>45 degrees)
   magnetopause (MP) and the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) have been
   analyzed in detail in order to study the structure and motion of the MP
   and LLBL regions. From a superposed epoch analysis of 59 of these
   events, we found the average high-shear ME to be characterized by large
   changes in the magnetic field magnitude, together with small increases
   of the parallel ion and electron temperatures as one crosses the
   boundary from the magnetosheath. Accelerated plasma flows, indicative
   of magnetic reconnection, are often seen in the MP/LLBL region, and in
   conjunction with these flows, one often observes an enhancement of the
   parallel ion temperature. Large changes in the plasma thermal
   properties occur at the inner edge of the LLBL, where the bulk of the
   magnetospheric particles is depleted. Using measured plasma flow
   velocity normal to the MP, we have estimated the MP speed. Comparing
   the results of the analysis of the 128 high-shear cases with results on
   22 low-shear crossings reported in an earlier paper, we conclude that
   the high-shear MP moves on average twice as fast as the low-shear one,
   while the duration of the crossings of the high-shear MP/LLBL is half
   that of the low-shear crossings, so that the average thickness' of the
   MP/LLBL is nearly independent of the local magnetic shear. In the range
   covered, the average MP/LLBL width is also found to be independent of
   the distance from the subsolar point. The normal speed (thickness) of
   the MP/LLBL is correlated (anticorrelated) with the magnetosheath
   plasma P. Furthermore, the normal speed of the MP tends to be
   anticorrelated with the crossing duration of the LLBL, implying that
   the width of the region does not vary as much as crossing durations
   imply. The (geometric) average widths of the high-shear and low-shear
   MP/LLBL are 1380 km (31 r(i,sheath), 15 r(i,sphere)) and 1100 km (27
   r(i,sheath,) 12 r(i,sphere)), respectively, where r(i,sheath) and
   r(i,sphere) are the average gyroradii of magnetosheath and
   magnetospheric protons. The average width of the entire region of
   current flow at the magnetopause is 630 km (14 r(i,sheath), 7
   r(i,sphere)) The width of the current flow region is also found to bd
   anticorrelated with the magnetosheath beta, while it is independent of
   r(i,sheath) and r(i,sphere).},

Title = {Asymmetric magnetic reconnection in the presence of a guide field},
Journal = JGR,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {114},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {The properties of asymmetric magnetic reconnection in the presence of a
   guide magnetic field are investigated using two-dimensional
   particle-in-cell simulations. The reconnection process is initiated by
   applying a spatially localized and temporally steady convection
   electric field at the high-density/low-magnetic-field (magnetosheath)
   side of the current layer. The in-plane Hall currents are dominated by
   the electron flows along the separatrices from the high-density to
   low-density side of the layer, and they strongly enhance the
   out-of-plane magnetic field in one hemisphere and decrease it in the
   other. On the enhanced magnetic field side are situated a bipolar pair
   of parallel electric fields and an electron velocity shear flow layer,
   both of which extend several ion inertia lengths (d(i)) away from the X
   line. The shear flow layer is unstable to the generation of small-scale
   (<< d(i)) electron vortices which propagate away from the X line and
   produce a reduction of the order of 30\% in the magnitude of the By
   field. An example of such a large-amplitude, short-duration depression
   in By is identified in a magnetopause crossing by the THEMIS
   spacecraft. The Ohm's law (E + U-e x B/c)(y) = 0 is violated in this
   parallel field/velocity shear region, and the deviation arises
   predominantly from the divergence of the electron pressure tensor.
   Criteria based on the demagnetization of the electrons (large values of
   the electron agyrotropy and the Lorentz ratio) are found to
   characterize neither the immediate electron scale region around the X
   line nor the larger electron shear flow region.},

Title = {Collisionless magnetic reconnection in an asymmetric current sheet},
Journal = JGR,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
Number = {A6},
Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {The process of collisionless magnetic reconnection in an ion-scale
   current sheet containing strong gradients in the density and magnetic
   field strength across the layer is investigated using two-dimensional
   particle-in-cell simulations. Such a current sheet configuration
   contains a strong normal polarization electric field on the high
   field/low density (magnetospheric) side of the layer. In initial-value
   simulations for such an asymmetric sheet, the reconnection rate and
   saturation level are found to be smaller by factors of 2-3 compared
   with a similar-scale symmetric current sheet. These rates are probably
   too small to explain observations at the dayside magnetopause. The
   addition of an external-driving electric field increases the
   reconnection rate substantially. This driven reconnection configuration
   is characterized by a nearly parallel inflow of electrons along the
   magnetosheath separatrices as the electrons attempt to flow from the
   high density side to the low density side of the layer, a strong
   outward flow of Poynting flux along the magnetospheric separatrices
   associated with the normal electric field and out-of-plane magnetic
   field, and a strong ion outflow jet. The outflow region on the
   magnetospheric side also exhibits a patchy parallel electric field
   structure and parallel electron velocity distributions with a
   counterstreaming feature. The addition of a moderate uniform magnetic
   guide field component (shear angle greater than or similar to 110
   degrees) has no appreciable effect on the reconnection rate but does
   produce a drift of the X line in the direction of the electron
   diamagnetic drift at a small fraction of the magnetosheath Alfven speed.},

Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Previous investigations of collisionless magnetic reconnection in a
   standard Harris neutral sheet configuration have demonstrated the
   importance of the Hall term for producing near-Alfvenic rates of
   reconnection and the existence of a very thin (similar toc/omega(pe))
   electron current layer and sharp density/pressure gradients on
   c/omega(pi) scales. The present work uses three-dimensional (3-D)
   particle-in-cell simulations with an open geometry to investigate the
   changes in the reconnection physics produced by a ``guide field{''}
   component B-0y of the magnetic field. With B-0y less than or similar to
   B-0, the nonlinear reconnection rate is not substantially modified from
   that for the Harris case. The properties of the reconnection fields and
   particle dynamics, however, are strongly altered. The familiar
   quadrupole B-y pattern is replaced by an enhancement of
   \textbackslash{}B-y\textbackslash{} between the separatrices. The
   enhanced parallel electric field and parallel electron velocity are
   confined to one pair of separatrix arms ( which are positively
   charged), while the electron current peaks on the other pair ( which
   are negatively charged). The ion outflow along the current sheet
   polarizes the separatrices, thereby creating large components of the
   in-plane electric field. The electrons are accelerated to form a beam
   structure with parallel speed limited by the electron Alfven speed. The
   beam-dominated electron distribution produces some y-dependent
   structures in E-parallel to. For B-0y >> B-0, the reconnection rate is
   reduced by a factor of 2-3, and the parallel fields and velocities are
   somewhat smaller; the Hall current produced perturbations in B-y are
   considerably reduced.}},

  abstract={Disruptive instabilities in PLT have been analysed by using an array of surface barrier X-ray detectors viewing the plasma cross-section along 20 chords. A wide variety of phenomena has been observed. A system of classification has been attempted, based upon: (1) the severity of the disruption, (2) the dominant precursor oscillations, and (3) the location of the onset of the disruption. Minor disruptions, in which the disruption does not appear at the location of the island of the precursor oscillation, have been observed, sometimes accompanied by seemingly independent higher-frequency oscillations of different helicity localized near the point of the disruption. Major disruptions exhibit flatter central q-profiles, slowing of the oscillations, asymmetry with respect to the centre of the discharge, and a correlation with high-Z impurity radiation.}

Abstract = {{Particle-in-cell simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are
   presented that demonstrate that reconnection remains fast in very large
   systems. The electron dissipation region develops a distinct two-scale
   structure along the outflow direction. Consistent with fast
   reconnection, the length of the electron current layer stabilizes and
   decreases with decreasing electron mass, approaching the ion inertial
   length for a proton-electron plasma. Surprisingly, the electrons form a
   super-Alfvenic outflow jet that remains decoupled from the magnetic
   field and extends large distances downstream from the x line.}},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
Number = {A7},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Observations made by a unique constellation of Cluster (at 14-16 R-E),
   TC2, Goes10, and LANL spacecraft (near 6.6 R-E) have allowed us to
   study the details of three reconnection events in the middle of a thick
   plasma sheet with the reconnection X-line located unusually close to
   Earth (10-12 R-E). We use mapping along field lines with magnetospheric
   models adapted to magnetic field observations to confirm that the
   reconnection region mapped onto localized auroral brightenings. Using
   simultaneous observations in the inflow and outflow regions, we
   describe an encounter with a localized tailward Alfvenic jet produced
   by a short isolated reconnection pulse. A good correlation between
   intense E and ion {[}BV] indicates that the concurrent strong
   turbulence could not destroy the frozen-in ion behavior in the
   reconnection outflow. We find that a steady quadrupole-like
   distribution of the magnetic By component in the turbulent reconnection
   outflow extended far beyond the ion diffusion region and existed for
   several minutes. We demonstrate an apparent V-x flow reversal, formed
   owing to the reappearance (switch-on) of reconnection at another
   location, rather than to a continuous motion of the active X-line.
   Using the Liouville mapping technique, we show that the acceleration of
   outflow electrons, after the particles passed a potential drop of 180
   V, is consistent with Fermi/betatron acceleration. We also suggest
   another interpretation of the energetic particle bursts at the onsets,
   to emphasize the role of seed population and explain the sudden burst
   as a consequence of changing magnetic topology.},

  abstract={A spectacular erupting feature with a plasmoid-like structure is observed before and during the solar flare that occurred on the limb on 1991 December 2 with the Y ohkoh soft X-ray telescope. The rise of a loop structure starts ~10 min before the flare, evolving to a plasmoid-like structure in the impulsive phase of the flare. The speed of the rising loop (plasmoid) is almost constant (~96 km s -1 ) throughout the observation. A clear X-shaped structure is formed underneath the rising plasmoid, and a bright soft X-ray loop is formed below the X-point. The X-shaped structure indicates a magnetic neutral point with a large-scale magnetic separatrix structure. Inverse-V-shaped high-temperature ridges are located above the soft X-ray loop and below the X-point. We interpret these as reconnected loops heated by slow shocks. A moving high-temperature (15 MK) source is found, coincident in position with the rising structure above the X-point. A hard X-ray source (33-53 keV) is located at the top of the soft X-ray flare loop. These two compact high-temperature sources located above and below the X-point would be formed by fast shocks due to the symmetric reconnection outflows both upward and downward from the X-point.}

Title = {{Two distinct energetic electron populations of different origin in the
   Earth's magnetotail: a Cluster case study}},
Journal = AG,
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1931-1948}},
Abstract = {{Energetic electrons (E >= 30keV) travelling along and perpendicular to
   the magnetic field lines have been observed in the magnetotail at L
   similar to 17:00 and 22:00 MLT during the recovery phase of a
   storm-time substorm on 7 October 2002. Three-dimensional electron
   distributions of the full unit sphere obtained from the IES/RAPID
   sensor system demonstrated a rather complicated and random behavior of
   the energetic electrons. Occasionally these electrons were appearing to
   travel parallel, perpendicular, or in both directions, relative to the
   magnetic field direction, forming in this way bi-directional,
   perpendicular peaked, and mixed distributions. The electron
   enhancements occurred while the Cluster spacecraft were on closed field
   lines in the central plasma sheet approaching the neutral sheet from
   the northern tail lobe. Magnetic field and energetic particle
   measurements have been used from geosynchronous and Cluster satellites,
   in order to describe the general context of the event and then give a
   possible interpretation regarding the occurrence of the electron
   anisotropies observed by the IES/RAPID spectrometer on board Cluster.
   According to geosynchronous measurements an electron dispersionless
   ejection is very well correlated with a dipolar re-configuration of the
   magnetic field. The latter fact supports the idea that electrons and,
   in general, particle ejections at geosynchronous altitude are directly
   related to electric fields arising from field dipolarization caused by
   current disruption. Also, having as a main objective the understanding
   of the way 3-D electron distributions are formed, we have analyzed
   electron energy spectra along and perpendicular to the magnetic field
   direction, demonstrating the fact that the electron population consists
   of two distinct components acting independently and in a random manner
   relative to each other. This leads to the conclusion that these two
   electron populations along and perpendicular to the field are generated
   at different remote locations at different rates. The main conclusion
   of the present paper is that the perpendicular-peaked electron
   enhancements (electrons with pitch angle around 90 degrees, subjected
   mainly to curvature drift) observed by Cluster are produced in a remote
   location duskward of the satellite location, due to the longitudinal
   and tailward expansion of a current disruption region, and subsequently
   transported to the Cluster location by means of curvature drift. On the
   other hand, bi-directional electrons (electrons with pitch angle around
   0 and 180 degrees, bouncing mainly along the field lines) are believed
   to be generated in the vicinity of the neutral sheet or around an
   X-type region, as suggested by a plethora of previous studies. Finally,
   in the Discussion section, we make an attempt to present in a more
   thorough way the substorm model developed by Vogiatzis et al. (2005),
   which is intimately related to the importance of X-line formation for
   the initiation of a substorm.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements from the Cluster spacecraft of electric fields, magnetic
   fields, and ions are used to study the structure and dynamics of the
   reconnection region in the tail at distances of similar to 18 R-E near
   22.4 MLT on 1 October 2001. This paper focuses on measurements of the
   large amplitude normal component of the electric field observed in the
   ion decoupling region near the reconnection x-line, the structure of
   the associated potential drops across the current sheet, and the role
   of the electrostatic potential structure in the ballistic acceleration
   of ions across the current sheet. The thinnest current sheet observed
   during this interval was bifurcated into a pair of current sheets and
   the measured width of the individual current sheet was 60-100 km (3-5
   c/omega(pe)). Coinciding with the pair of thin current sheets is a
   large-amplitude (+/-60 mV/m) bipolar electric field structure directed
   normal to the current sheets toward the midplane of the plasma sheet.
   The potential drop between the outer boundary of the thin current sheet
   and the neutral sheet due to this electric field is 4-6 kV. This
   electric field structure produces a 4-6 kV electric potential well
   centered on the separatrix region. Measured H+ velocity space
   distributions obtained inside the current layers provide evidence that
   the H+ fluids from the northern and southern tail lobes are accelerated
   into the potential well, producing a pair of counterstreaming,
   monoenergetic H+ beams. These beams are directed within 20 degrees of
   the normal direction with energies of 4-6 keV. The data also suggest
   there is ballistic acceleration of O+ in a similar larger-scale
   potential well of 10-30 kV spatially coinciding with the larger scale
   size (similar to 1000-3000 km) portions of current sheet surrounding
   the thin current sheet. Distribution functions show counterstreaming O+
   populations with energies of similar to 20 keV accelerated along the
   average normal direction within this large-scale potential structure.
   The normal component of the electric field in the thin current sheet
   layer is large enough to drive an E x B drift of the electrons similar
   to 10,000 km/s (0.25 x electron Alfven velocity), which can account for
   the magnitude of the cross-tail current associated with the thin
   current sheet.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Three-dimensional (3-D) particle simulations are performed in a
   double current layer configuration to investigate the stability of
   current sheets and boundary layers which develop during magnetic
   reconnection of antiparallel fields in collisionless plasma. The strong
   current layers that develop near the x line remain surprisingly
   laminar, with no evidence of turbulence and associated anomalous
   resistivity or viscosity. Neither the electron shear flow instabilities
   nor kink-like instabilities, which have been observed in these current
   layers in earlier simulations, are present. The sharp boundary layers
   which form between the inflow and outflow regions downstream of the x
   line are unstable to the lower hybrid drift instability. The associated
   fluctuations, however, do not strongly impact the rate of reconnection.
   As a consequence, magnetic reconnection in the 3-D system remains
   nearly two dimensional.}},
