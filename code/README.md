# Manifolder

Python implementation of "Empirical Intrinsic Geometry" (EIG) code, for machine learning multivariate time-series.

The algorithm was originally described in the 2014 paper "Intrinsic modeling of stochastic dynamical systems using empirical geometry" by Talmon and Coifman  ([pdf](https://ronentalmon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ACHA_EIG.pdf)), and ported to Python from the [original MATLAB](http://www.runmycode.org/companion/view/191) code,written by Ronen Talmon (2013).

This port is open-sourced under the MIT license.

### Overview

Manifolder uses the sklearn-like interface.  In the simplest case, data is loaded as a time series, where the rows are the time steps, and the columns are the features.  (This is the standard Python data format; note that inside the Manifolder class, the data is stored transposed, with columns as time, for compatibility with the original code).


```python
import manifolder as mr

# load the data
df = pd.read_csv('data/simple_data.csv', header=None)
z = df.values
print('loaded',data_location + ', shape:', z.shape)

# create manifolder object
manifolder = mr.Manifolder()

# add the data, and fit (this runs all the functions)
# make sure data is loaded as with [time,features] orientation
manifolder.fit_transform( z )

manifolder._clustering()  # display
```

The EIG technique used by Manifolder relies on the data in `z` being an unbroken series of observations (i.e., they are a time series), typically represented in a single matrix.  The manifold can also be constructed using multiple sets of time series.  In this case, data is loaded as list of matrices, like `z = [za, zb, zc, ...]`.  Note the number of features (columns) must be the same in all the matrices, but each can be of a different length, as long as the time series in each is contigious.



### Installing and Running

Make sure you have a recent version of Python on your system, such as [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), installed on your system.

Manifolder can be pip installed.  Open a terminal and run

```python
$ pip install git+https://github.com/avlab/manifolder
```

If needed, the software can be uninstalled with `pip uninstall manifolder`.

To see a quick demo of the code, check out the [manifolder_notebook](https://github.com/avlab/manifolder/blob/master/manifolder_notebook.ipynb), which calculates an underlynig 3-dimensional manifold from an 8-dimensional timeseries, for both synthetic and real-world (solar wind) data.


### Porting Notes

Package implements the algorithm described in the paper *2014 Talmon and Coifman - Intrinsic modeling of stochastic dynamical systems using empirical geometry* [.pdf](https://ronentalmon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ACHA_EIG.pdf)

Initial code is essentially a port of the original MATLAB code.  To make the ported code as clear as possible, the python translation strives to keep most of the original variable names and structure.  For instance, time series in the MATLAB code is encoded as rows in `z`, and the orientation is the same in the Python code.

Indexing starts at zero in Python, and one in MATLAB.  The port adopts the correct Python indexing (starting at one), to prevent confusion for Python users of the library.  For the most part, this change is almost transparent, since both languages keep their native idioms.  For instance, a MATLAB loop like

```octave
# MATLAB Loop

for dim=1:N
	# do something
end
```

is replaced by the equivalent 

```python
# Python Loop

for dim in range(N):  # note, loop will run in standard Python, starting at dim = 0
    # do something
```

### Packaging In GIT

[https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) is the main resource for creating a package - maybe this can be added to contributing?  Also, include notes on code formatting, etc.?

The code that actually runs is

(update `setuptools` and `wheel`):

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
```

Now run this command from the same directory where `setup.py` is located:

```bash
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

[maybe better](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/) `python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal`

This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two files in the `dist`directory:

This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two files in the `dist`directory:

```
dist/
  example_pkg_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
  example_pkg_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1.tar.gz
```

... and also creates `manifolder_pkg_avlab.egg-info/` directory

At this point the distribution is build, and should be uploadable to github and installable.
