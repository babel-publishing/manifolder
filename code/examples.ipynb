    "1. some simple test data,\n",

    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Test data\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `data/simple_data.csv` contains 8 channels of timeseries test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was built to be a test case that any method of timeseries clustering should be able to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has clearly defined modes, visible to the naked eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, only the first column contains the test signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This column contains a few different, repeating signal types.\n",
    "\n",
    "All channels have low-level noise added, for numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, `Manifolder` cannot determine the number of dimensions of the\n",
    "underlying manifold in an unsupervised manner. Like KMeans, the first\n",
    "parameter to the constructor is the user's \"guess\", which will determine\n",
    "the structures `Manifolder` looks for.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, calling `Manifolder(dim=3)` will attempt to project the signal\n",
    "into an an underlying 3-dimensional manifold."
