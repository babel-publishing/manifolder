# Contributing

The repository is structured along standard Python and open-source guidelines, wherever possible.  Defaulting to established standards for repository structure, code formatting, and collaboration allows users familiar with other projects to quickly get up to speed.  Using established standards piggy-backs on many of the excellent guides and tutorials that are out there.

Since the goal of the project is to create a package that can be `pip` installed in Python, the project follows the structure suggested in [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).  

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) also also a good resource.  The [Starting an Open Source Project](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/) guide has a good breakdown of initial parts of an open source project.

If you're stumped, here are some good examples of contribution guidelines:

- The Atom editor [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- The Ruby on Rails [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- The Open Government [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Code Formatting

The [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code | Python.org](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) defines the standard Python coding style.  Most groups code within some variant of these standards, and it is important to have publicially available package formatted correctly.

Various autoformatters insure that the coding style is followed; we frequently simply use PyCharm's built it formatter (`option+command+L`), which is a simple way to enforce a resonable, uniform style.
